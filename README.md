The Cake Bar is expanding their online ordering service and want your help. To better plan pancake production, the Cake Bar needs to prompt online customers for a pickup time.  The Cake Bar has already written some code for these three new requirements:  Orders can only be served on the hour, between 8:00 and 12:00. Pick up time must be displayed in #:00 format in the order ticket after submission. The field in the order ticket must be labeled “Pick up time:” In this project, you’ll first manually test for each requirement, then write an automated test. You’ll run the test, find the erroneous code, and fix it.  For both the tests and fixes, you’ll be provided with some code that you may not be familiar with. That’s okay! The focus of this project is the process of testing, not the specific syntax.
